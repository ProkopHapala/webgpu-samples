Okay, this is a great idea! Here's a step-by-step cookbook for setting up and running the `webgpu-samples` project, specifically highlighting the points that were not clear during our conversation.

# WebGPU Samples Setup & Run Guide (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)

This guide provides a step-by-step process to get the `webgpu-samples` project running on your Ubuntu 24.04 LTS system, including resolving common Node.js and dependency issues.

## Prerequisites

*   A fresh install of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.
*   `git` installed (for cloning the repository).
*   Internet connection.

## Step-by-Step Cookbook

### 1. Clone the WebGPU Samples Repository

First, get the project files onto your system.

```bash
cd ~/git_SW/ # Or your preferred development directory
git clone https://github.com/webgpu/webgpu-samples.git
cd webgpu-samples
```

### 2. Install Node Version Manager (NVM)

**Why NVM?** You initially had issues with an outdated Node.js version. NVM allows you to easily install and switch between different Node.js versions without affecting your system's default Node.js installation (if any). This is crucial for compatibility with various projects.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
```

### 3. Activate NVM in Your Current Terminal Session

**⚠️ This was a common point of confusion!** The `nvm` installer modifies your `~/.bashrc` file (which is loaded when you open a new terminal), but your *current* terminal session doesn't automatically reload it. You need to manually load NVM for the current session to make the `nvm` command available.

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```
*(You can paste all three lines at once and press Enter.)*

**Note:** For *new* terminal windows or tabs you open in the future, `nvm` will be automatically available, so you won't need to run these three lines again.

### 4. Install the Latest Node.js LTS Version

Now that `nvm` is active, install a compatible Node.js version. The "LTS" (Long Term Support) version is recommended for stability. This step directly addresses the initial `npm WARN EBADENGINE` (Unsupported Engine) warnings you encountered.

```bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts # Ensure this version is active in your current session
```

**Verify the installation:**

```bash
node -v # Should show v20.x.x or v22.x.x (latest LTS)
npm -v  # Should show a recent npm version
```

### 5. Aggressively Update Project Dependencies

You expressed a desire to remove as many deprecation warnings as possible. This step uses `npm-check-updates` (`ncu`) to force updates to the *latest available major versions* of dependencies, even if they might introduce breaking changes (which you're okay with for a sample project).

a. **Install `npm-check-updates` globally:**

```bash
npm install -g npm-check-updates
```

b. **Review and apply suggested updates to `package.json`:**
First, see what `ncu` recommends (it won't change anything yet):

```bash
ncu
```
Then, update your `package.json` file with the latest versions:

```bash
ncu -u
```

### 6. Install Updated Dependencies and Synchronize `package-lock.json`

**⚠️ This was another crucial point!** After `ncu -u` updates your `package.json`, your `package-lock.json` file (which locks exact dependency versions for reproducible builds) will be out of sync. Trying `npm ci` directly after `ncu -u` will fail because `npm ci` strictly requires these files to match.

You need to run `npm install` to tell `npm` to read the new versions from `package.json`, download them, and most importantly, **update your `package-lock.json` file** to reflect these changes.

```bash
npm install
```

**What to expect:** This command will download and install all packages according to the new versions specified in `package.json`, and will update your `package-lock.json`. This is where many of the `npm WARN deprecated` messages should disappear.

**Optional Check:**
After `npm install`, you can run `npm audit` again to confirm there are no new security vulnerabilities:

```bash
npm audit
```
(You should still see `found 0 vulnerabilities`, which is great!)

### 7. Run the WebGPU Samples Project

This is the final step to see the samples in action!

**⚠️ This was the point where you thought it was "stuck"!** The `npm start` command typically initiates a build process, then starts a local web server, and then starts a "watcher" that waits for file changes. It's not stuck; it's actively running.

```bash
npm start
```

You'll see output similar to this:
```
add: public/menu.svg out/menu.svg
... (many file additions/copies)
server started on ::8080 for path: /home/prokop/git_SW/webgpu-samples/out
available on:
   http://localhost:8080
   http://127.0.0.1:8080
   http://10.26.201.142:8080
...
[2025-05-30 10:38:45] waiting for changes...
```

### 8. Access the Samples in Your Web Browser

Open your web browser (e.g., Firefox, Chrome) and navigate to the local address provided in the terminal output. The most common one is:

*   **`http://localhost:8080`**

You should now see the WebGPU Samples index page!

## Important Notes

*   **Stopping the Server:** To stop the running server and watcher process, go back to your terminal where `npm start` is running and press `CTRL + C`.
*   **Deprecation Warnings:** After all these steps, you might still see a *few* deprecation warnings. This is often unavoidable in older projects or with deep transitive dependencies (dependencies of your dependencies) that simply haven't been updated by their maintainers. As long as `npm audit` reports "0 vulnerabilities" and the project runs, these are generally acceptable for a sample project.
*   **"Waiting for changes..."**: This means the development server is actively watching your project files. If you were to make a change to a source file (e.g., a `.ts` or `.wgsl` file), the watcher would automatically recompile and sometimes even refresh your browser, making development easier.
